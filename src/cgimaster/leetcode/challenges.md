## 001. Two Sum: Easy
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## 002. Add Two Numbers: Medium

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:
```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

## 004. Median Of Two Sorted Arrays: Hard

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Example 1:
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```
Example 2:
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```

## 005. Largest Palindromic Substring: Medium
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
```
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

##006. ZigZag Conversion: Medium
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
```
Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string s, int numRows);
Example 1:
```
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
```
Explanation:
```
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
```

## 013. Romain to Integer: Easy
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```
For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. 
However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. 
Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Example 1:
```
Input: "III"
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "IV"
Output: 4
```
Example 3:
```
Input: "IX"
Output: 9
```
Example 4:
```
Input: "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: C = 100, L = 50, XXX = 30 and III = 3.
```
Example 5:
```
Input: "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

## 018. 4 Sum: Medium
Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in nums such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

Example:
```
Given array nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.

A solution set is:
[
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]
]
```

## 20. Valid Parentheses: Easy

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

```
Input: "()"
Output: true
```
