## 001. Two Sum: Easy
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

## 002. Add Two Numbers: Medium

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:
```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

## 004. Median Of Two Sorted Arrays: Hard

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Example 1:
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```
Example 2:
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```

## 005. Largest Palindromic Substring: Medium
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:
```
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

##006. ZigZag Conversion: Medium
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
```
Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string s, int numRows);
Example 1:
```
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
```
Explanation:
```
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
```

## 013. Romain to Integer: Easy
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```
For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. 
However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. 
Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Example 1:
```
Input: "III"
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "IV"
Output: 4
```
Example 3:
```
Input: "IX"
Output: 9
```
Example 4:
```
Input: "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: C = 100, L = 50, XXX = 30 and III = 3.
```
Example 5:
```
Input: "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

## 018. 4 Sum: Medium
Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, are there elements a, b, c, and d in nums such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

Example:
```
Given array nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.

A solution set is:
[
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]
]
```

## 20. Valid Parentheses: Easy

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

```
Input: "()"
Output: true
```

## 23. Merge k Sorted Lists (Linked Lists: Hard)
```
Solutions:
1. Add all elements to list, sort and create new LL
2. Use Priority Queue
```

## 98. Validate Binary Search Tree 

## 101. Symmetric Tree (Trees: Easy)
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).
```
For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
```
```
But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:
    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
```
Note:
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.

## 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (Trees: Medium)
Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example:
```
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its level order traversal as:
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
```



## 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:
```
Input: [1,2,3]
    1
   / \
  2   3
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [4,9,0,5,1]
    4
   / \
  9   0
 / \
5   1
Output: 1026
```
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.

## 200. Number of Islands
Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. 
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. 
You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:
```
Input:
11110
11010
11000
00000

Output: 1
```

Example 2:
```
Input:
11000
11000
00100
00011

Output: 3
```

```
Solution Summary:
Recursively explore islands and use another memory grid to memorize visited cells.

```

## 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Example 1:
```
Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4
```
Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.

## 261. Graph Valid Tree (Trees & Graphs: Medium)
Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n-1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,4]]
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 5, and edges = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,3], [1,4]]
Output: false
```
Note: you can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0,1] is the same as [1,0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

```
Solution Summary: 
Union Find algorithm. Union edges and return False if they previously had same root.

```


## 270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value
Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.
Example:
```
Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286

    4
   / \
  2   5
 / \

```
Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1

  2
 / \
1   3

Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```

1

Output: null
```

## 314. Binary Tree Vertical Order Traversal (Trees: Medium)
