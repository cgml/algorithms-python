# Arrays & Strings

## Move Zeros
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example:
```
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```
Note:
You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.


## Add Binary
Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters 1 or 0.

Example 1:
```
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```

## Intersection of Two Arrays
Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
```
Note:

Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.
The result can be in any order.
Follow up:

What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your algorithm?
What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is better?
What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?

## 3 Sum
Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:
```
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```

## Valid Palindrome
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Note: For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

Example 1:
```
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "race a car"
Output: false
```

## Minimum Size Subarray Sum
Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum ≥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

Example: 
```
Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
```
Follow up:
If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n).


## Valid Parentheses
Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Example 1:
```
Input: "()"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true
```
Example 3:
Input: "(]"
Output: false
```
Example 4:
Input: "([)]"
Output: false
```
Example 5:
```
Input: "{[]}"
Output: true
```

# Linked Lists
## Remove Nth Node From End of List
Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its head.

Example:
```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```
Note:

Given n will always be valid.

Could you do this in one pass?


## Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List
Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example, given the following tree:
```
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
```
The flattened tree should look like:
```
1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
```
