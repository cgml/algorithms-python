Given undirected graph with positive connected edges
Definition: A spanning tree of graph G is a subgraph T that is both
    a Tree (connected and acyclic)
    and spanning (includes all the vertices)

Goal: Find min weight spanning tree

Brute force: all possible spanning trees

Example: Bicycle roots in city
